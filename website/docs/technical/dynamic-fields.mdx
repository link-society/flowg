# Dynamic Fields

Dynamic fields are mainly used in [Forwarder](/docs/technical/forwarders)
configuration. They allow you to define fields whose values are computed at
runtime based on the log record being processed.

In the web interface, dynamic fields appears with a dropdown menu, allowing the
user to select between "Static" and "Expression" modes.

In the API, a dynamic field is represented as a string. If the string starts
with `@expr:`, the rest of the string is treated as an expression to be
evaluated for each log record. Otherwise, the string is treated as a static
value.

> **NB:** Not all fields are dynamic, consult the documentation of each
> forwarder to know which fields support dynamic values.

## Edition mode

### Static

import DynamicFieldExampleStatic from '@site/static/img/technical/dynamic-field-example-static.png'

In static mode, the user can enter a fixed value for the field. This value will
be used for all log records processed by the forwarder.

Under the hood, the value is sent as-is to the API:

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'start',
    gap: '2rem',
  }}
>
  <div>
    <img src={DynamicFieldExampleStatic} alt="Dynamic field example - static mode" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ fontSize: '4rem' }}>
    &rArr;
  </div>
  <div className="codeblock-nomargin">
    ```json
    {
      "tag": "example"
    }
    ```
  </div>
</div>

### Expression

import DynamicFieldExampleExpr from '@site/static/img/technical/dynamic-field-example-expr.png'

In expression mode, the user can enter an expression in the
[Expr](https://expr-lang.org/) language. This expression will be evaluated for
each log record processed by the forwarder, and the result will be used as the
value of the field.

> **NB:** The expression must evaluate to a string.

Under the hood, the value is sent to the API as a string prefixed with `@expr:`:

<div
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'start',
    gap: '2rem',
  }}
>
  <div>
    <img src={DynamicFieldExampleExpr} alt="Dynamic field example - expression mode" />
  </div>
  <div style={{ fontSize: '4rem' }}>
    &rArr;
  </div>
  <div className="codeblock-nomargin">
    ```json
    {
      "tag": "@expr:log.tag"
    }
    ```
  </div>
</div>

## Available variables

A log record, in its JSON format looks like this:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T12:34:56+01:00",
  "fields": {
    "foo": "bar"
  }
}
```

The expression used in dynamic fields has access to the following variables:

| Variable Name | Description                   | Example Value                 |
| --------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `log`         | The log fields as an object   | `{ "foo": "bar" }`            |
| `timestamp`   | The log timestamp as a string | `"2026-01-15T12:34:56+01:00"` |
