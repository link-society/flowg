# Receive notifications from Uptime Kuma

[Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) is a lightweight, self-hosted
monitoring tool. It supports out of the box many types of notifications to alert
third-party systems when a service goes down.

In this tutorial, we will setup Uptime Kuma to send notifications to FlowG using
the Webhook notification.

## Setting up Uptime Kuma

First, run the Uptime Kuma container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name uptime-kuma \
  -v uptime-kuma:/app/data \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  louislam/uptime-kuma:1
```

You can now access Uptime Kuma at http://localhost:3001.

Set up an admin user and create a test monitor. For testing purposes, we will
create an HTTP check to query [HttpBin](https://httpbin.org/) at the following
URL:

```
https://httpbin.org/status/200,400,500
```

This will randomly return a 200, 400 or 500 status code.

Then, let's create a webhook notification:

| Field | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notification Type | Webhook | We will send the notification directly on a pipeline |
| Friendly Name | FlowG | You can use any value you want |
| Post URL | `http://localhost:5080/api/v1/pipelines/default/logs` | Adjust this URL to send the logs to the desired pipeline, here `default` |
| Request Body | Custom Body | In order to build the request body the FlowG pipeline endpoint expects |

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "record": {
    "message": "{{ msg }}",
    "monitor.name": "{{ monitorJSON['name'] }}",
    "heartbeat.status": "{{ heartbeatJSON['status'] }}",
  }
}
```

Then, enable the additional headers and type in the following:

```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "Authorization": "Bearer pat:YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN"
}
```

Save, and let the check run.

## Setting up FlowG

import UptimeKumaLogsUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/uptime-kuma/uptime-kuma-logs.png'

When FlowG starts for the first time, a default pipeline is created which simply
store the logs in the `default` stream. No further setup is required to receive
the logs from Uptime Kuma:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }} class="with-zoom">
  <img src={UptimeKumaLogsUrl} alt="Uptime Kuma logs in FlowG" />
</div>

## What's next?

You can then process the logs, refine them, parse the message, and/or forward
them to a third-party system such as a remote Syslog, Datadog, or even another
HTTP Webhook.
