# Forwarding logs to RabbitMQ

## Introduction

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a reliable and mature messaging and
streaming broker.

It supports the [AMQP 0-9-1](https://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-protocol)
protocol, which FlowG can use to send logs to RabbitMQ.

## Setting up RabbitMQ

You need to declare an *exchange* to receive logs. You can do this using the
[Management CLI](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/management-cli):

```bash
rabbitmqadmin --vhost flowg declare exchange \
  --name "flowg.default" \
  --type "topic" \
  --durable "true"
```

## Setting up the FlowG pipeline

import ForwarderAmqpUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/rabbitmq/forwarder-amqp.png'
import PipelineWithAmqpUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/rabbitmq/pipeline-with-amqp.png'


First, let's create an "AMQP Forwarder" named `rabbitmq`, with the following
configuration:

| Property | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL | `amqp://user:password@1.2.3.4:5672/flowg` | Adjust the URL according to your setup, the path correspond to the Virtual Host in which we created the exchange above |
| Exchange | `flowg.default` | This is the exchange we created above |
| Routing Key | `a.b.c` | You can use any value you want actually |

<div
  style={{
    textAlign: 'center',
    border: '1px solid #CCCCCC',
    margin: '2rem 0',
    padding: '0.25rem',
  }}
>
  <img src={ForwarderAmqpUrl} alt="AMQP Forwarder Configuration" />
</div>

Then, create a pipeline that forwards logs to the `rabbitmq` forwarder:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={PipelineWithAmqpUrl} alt="Pipeline with AMQP Forwarder" />
</div>

And that's it!

## What's next?

Messages will be sent with the content-type `application/json`, you can then
consume them using any AMQP client.
