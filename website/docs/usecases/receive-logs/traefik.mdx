# Traefik (via OpenTelemetry)

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.
It supports exporting logs to an [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
endpoint.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) OpenTelemetry is a collection of
APIs, SDKs, and tools used to instrument, generate, collect, and export
telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software's
performance and behavior.

**FlowG** can be used to gather logs from any OpenTelemetry compatible exporter.

> :warning: **Important Notice**

> FlowG only supports gathering logs for now, and does not support metrics and

In this tutorial, we will setup Traefik to export logs to FlowG using the
OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) over HTTP.

## Setting up Traefik

Run Traefik with the following configuration:

```yaml
experimental:
  otlpLogs: true

log:
  otlp:
    http:
      endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1/pipelines/default/logs/otlp
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN
```

> **NB:** This assumes FlowG is running on the same host as Traefik.

Here is another example using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    environment:
      - TRAEFIK_EXPERIMENTAL_OTLPLOGS=true
      - TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
      - TRAEFIK_LOG_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://flowg:5080/api/v1/pipelines/default/logs/otlp
      - TRAEFIK_LOG_OTLP_HTTP_HEADERS_AUTHORIZATION=Bearer YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN
    ports:
      - "80:80"

  flowg:
    image: linksociety/flowg:latest
    ports:
      - "5080:5080"
```

Then run with:

```bash
docker compose up flowg
# Create your personal access token and set it in the environment variable
docker compose up traefik
```

## Setting up FlowG

import TraefikLogsUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/traefik/traefik-logs.png'

When FlowG starts for the first time, a default pipeline is created which simply
store the logs in the `default` stream. No further setup is required to receive
the logs from Traefik:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }} class="with-zoom">
  <img src={TraefikLogsUrl} alt="Traefik logs in FlowG" />
</div>

## What's next?

You can then process the logs, refine them, parse the message, and/or forward
them to a third-party system such as a remote Syslog, Datadog, or even another
HTTP Webhook.

See the other guides for more ideas.
