# Docker Syslog Driver

Since FlowG has a Syslog endpoint, it can be used as a logging driver for Docker
containers, allowing you to gather, parse, transform, refine and store or
forward your logs to third-party services.

In this tutorial, we will setup FlowG as a logging driver for:

 - specific Docker containers using the Docker CLI
 - specific Docker containers using Docker Compose
 - all Docker containers by configuring the Docker Daemon

> **NB:** We will assume that FlowG is running on localhost with the Syslog
> endpoint listening on `UDP:5514`. You can tune the configuration as you need.

## Setting up a Docker container

import DockerLogsUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/docker/docker-logs.png'

### Using the Docker CLI

Add the following parameters to your `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --log-driver=syslog \
  --log-opt syslog-address=udp://localhost:5514 \
  nginx:alpine
```

You can now check the logs in FlowG:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }} class="with-zoom">
  <img src={DockerLogsUrl} alt="Docker logs in FlowG" />
</div>

### Using Docker Compose

You can also set the logging driver in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    logging:
      driver: syslog
      options:
        syslog-address: udp://localhost:5514
```

Then simply run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Setting up the Docker Daemon

If you want to set the logging driver for all containers, you can configure the
Docker Daemon to use FlowG as the default logging driver.

To do this, create or edit the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file and add the
following:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "syslog",
  "log-opts": {
    "syslog-address": "udp://localhost:5514"
  }
}
```

Then restart the Docker Daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

> **NB:** You will need to recreate your containers for the new logging driver
> to take effect.
