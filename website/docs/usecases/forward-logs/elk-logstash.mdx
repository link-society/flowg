# ELK (via Logstash)

## Introduction

FlowG allows you to view the logs your pipelines stored in streams. But the
log viewer is pretty much barebones, as the main feature of FlowG is the
pipeline itself. For that reason, you might want to forward logs to an
[ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack), so that you can use
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) to view your logs.

Fortunately, FlowG is able to forward logs to a remote Syslog Server, and
[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) can act as a Syslog Server to
receive logs.

In this tutorial, we will setup an ELK stack using
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and a FlowG pipeline to
forward logs to it.

## Setting up ELK

We will be using the [docker-elk](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk)
project, which does the heavy lifting for us:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk.git
cd docker-elk
```

Edit the file `logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf` with the following content:

```logstash
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }

  syslog {
    port => 50000
    type => "flowg-syslog"
    grok_pattern => "<%{POSINT:flowg_syslog_priority}>%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:flowg_syslog_timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:flowg_syslog_hostname} %{DATA:flowg_syslog_program}(?:\[%{POSINT:flowg_syslog_pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:flowg_syslog_content}"
  }
}

filter {
  if [type] == "flowg-syslog" {
    json {
      source => "flowg_syslog_content"
      target => "flowg_record"
    }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"
    user => "logstash_internal"
    password => "${LOGSTASH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD}"
  }
}
```

Finally, start the stack using the following commands:

```bash
docker compose up setup
docker compose up
```

This can take a few minutes, then you can access Kibana at:

 - http://localhost:5601

With the following credentials: `elastic` / `changeme`.

## Setting up the FlowG pipeline

import ForwarderElkUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/elk/forwarder-elk.png'
import PipelineWithElkUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/elk/pipeline-with-elk.png'

First, let's create a "Syslog Forwarder" named `elk`, with the following
configuration:

| Property | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Network | `TCP` | UDP works as well, Logstash starts a listener for each protocol |
| Server Address | `127.0.0.1:50000` | Assuming your FlowG is running on the same host as the ELK stack we started above |
| Tag | `flowg` | You can use any value you want actually |
| Severity | `INFO` | You can use any value you want |
| Facility | `LOCAL0` | You can use any value you want |

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={ForwarderElkUrl} alt="ELK Forwarder Configuration" />
</div>

Then, create a pipeline that forwards logs to the `elk` forwarder:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={PipelineWithElkUrl} alt="Pipeline with ELK Forwarder" />
</div>

And that's it!

## Testing

import KibanaUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/elk/kibana.png'

You can test the setup by sending a log to the pipeline using the `logger`
command:

```bash
logger -n localhost -P 5514 -t myapp 'hello world'
```

You can then find your log in Kibana at the following URL:

 - http://localhost:5601/app/discover
