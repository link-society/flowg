# OpenTelemetry

## Introduction

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized way to collect, process, and export telemetry data. FlowG allows you to forward logs to any OpenTelemetry-compatible system using the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) HTTP endpoint.

## Setting up OpenTelemetry

To receive logs from FlowG, you need an OpenTelemetry Collector or any system that supports the OTLP HTTP protocol. The default OTLP HTTP endpoint for logs is typically:

```
http://localhost:4318/v1/logs
```

## Setting up the FlowG pipeline

First, let's create an "OpenTelemetry Forwarder" named `otlp`, with the following configuration:

| Property | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endpoint | `http://localhost:4318/v1/logs` | The OTLP HTTP endpoint for logs |
| Headers | `{}` | Optional headers to send with the request |

Then, create a pipeline that forwards logs to the `otlp` forwarder.

And that's it!

## Testing

You can test the setup by sending a log to the pipeline using the `logger` command:

```bash
logger -n localhost -P 5514 -t my-app 'hello world'
```

The log will be forwarded to your OpenTelemetry endpoint in the OTLP format.

## What's next?

Once the logs are received by your OpenTelemetry system, you can:
- View them in your preferred observability platform
- Process them using OpenTelemetry processors
- Export them to other systems using OpenTelemetry exporters
