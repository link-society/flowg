# Forwarding logs to Datadog

## Introduction

[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a monitoring and analytics platform
with great visualization capabilities. FlowG allows you to take advantage of
Datadog's features by forwarding logs to it.

## Setting up Datadog

import DatadogApiKeyUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/datadog/datadog-apikey.png'

**DataDog** provides an HTTP endpoint to receive logs (see the
[documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#send-logs)). It
expects in its payload the following properties:

| Property | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ddsource` | string | `nginx` |
| `ddtags` | string | `env:prod,version:1.0` |
| `hostname` | string | `myhost` |
| `service` | string | `myapp` |
| `message` | string | `my log message` |

All you need is to create an API Key in your Datadog account:

<div
  style={{
    textAlign: 'center',
    border: '1px solid #CCCCCC',
    margin: '2rem 0',
    padding: '0.25rem',
  }}
>
  <img src={DatadogApiKeyUrl} alt="DataDog API Key creation" />
</div>

## Setting up the FlowG pipeline

import ForwarderDatadogUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/datadog/forwarder-datadog.png'
import PipelineWithDatadog from '@site/static/img/guides/datadog/pipeline-with-datadog.png'

First, let's create a "Datadog Forwarder" named `dd`, with the following
configuration:

| Property | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| URL | `https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com/api/v2/logs` | This is the endpoint to send logs to |
| API Key | N/A | This is an API Key you created earlier |

<div
  style={{
    textAlign: 'center',
    border: '1px solid #CCCCCC',
    margin: '2rem 0',
    padding: '0.25rem',
  }}
>
  <img src={ForwarderDatadogUrl} alt="Datadog Forwarder Configuration" />
</div>


> :warning: **Important Notice**
>
> The API Key is tied to the "site" you use. The URL **MUST** match, otherwise
> you will receive a 403 error when trying to submit logs.
>
> For example, if you are in Europe, the URL should be:
> `https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu/api/v2/logs`

Then, let's create a transformer named `prepare-dd` with the following code:

```
. = {
  "ddtags": "test:flowg",
  "ddsource": "logger",
  "hostname": .hostname,
  "service": "terminal",
  "message": .content
}
```

This will setup the structure of the log record to the one expected by the
Datadog HTTP Intake API.

Finally, create a pipeline that transforms logs received via Syslog and forwards
them to the `dd` forwarder:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img src={PipelineWithDatadog} alt="Pipeline with Datadog Forwarder" />
</div>

And that's it!

## Testing

import DatadogLogExplorerUrl from '@site/static/img/guides/datadog/datadog-logexplorer.png'


You can test the setup by sending a log to the pipeline using the `logger`
command:

```bash
logger -n localhost -P 5514 --rfc3164 -t myapp 'hello world'
```

You can then find your logs in Datadog at one of the following URLs depending on
your region:

 - https://app.datadoghq.com/logs
 - https://app.datadoghq.eu/logs
 - ...

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }} class="with-zoom">
  <img src={DatadogLogExplorerUrl} alt="FlowG logs in Datadog" />
</div>
