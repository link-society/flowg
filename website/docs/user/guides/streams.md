# What Are Streams?

A stream is the destination of a log record after being processed by a pipeline.
This is the actual collection that you will query/visualize using
[filters](/docs/user/guides/filtering).

Every field can be indexed, allowing fast retrieval of log records matching some
[filter](/docs/user/guides/filtering).
