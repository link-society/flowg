FlowG is a log management platform that lets you ingest, transform, and query
logs using a visual pipeline builder. It handles structured logs without
requiring predefined schemas and relies on
[BadgerDB](https://dgraph.io/docs/badger/) as its storage backend.

For more informations, consult the
[documentation](https://link-society.github.io/flowg/docs/).

## :sparkles: Key Features

 - **Pipelines:** Build and manage log processing pipelines visually, with
   support for transormations with [VRL](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/)
   scripts and conditional routing to dedicated streams
 - **Dynamic Logs:** Manage logs with varying structures without needing
   predefined schemas
 - **Interoperability:** Configuration and log ingestion can entirely be done
   via the REST API
 - **Observability:** Query and visualize logs in real-time in the integrated
   Web interface

## :question: Why should I use this?

**FlowG**'s primary goal is to make log refinement and routing as easy as
possible. As such, it relies on [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev) to help you
build such pipelines with as little code as possible. For the actual code part,
we use the [Vector Remap Language](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/),
which gives a solid base for log refinement.

It aims to replace tools like [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) by
integrating the feature right in the solution.

It also leverages [BadgerDB](https://dgraph.io/docs/badger/) which is a battle
tested Key/Value database, with the right feature set to easily support indexing
dynamically structured logs, as well as log compression.

## :zap: Benchmark

Run with (see *Build* section bellow):

```bash
export BENCHMARK_ITERATIONS="1000000"
export BENCHMARK_JOBS="24"  # usually, number of CPUs
task docker:build test:bench
```

System:

 - **CPU:** 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700K
 - **RAM:** 64GB

Result:

```
Requests sent: 1000000
Total time:    266.75s
Rate:          3748.76 req/s
```

## :building_construction: Build

**Requirements:**

 - Go 1.22+
 - C Toolchain
 - Rust and Cargo (edition 2021)
 - NodeJS

```bash
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
task build:all
```

Then, start the server with:

```bash
./bin/flowg-server \
  --auth-dir ./data/auth \
  --log-dir ./data/logs \
  --config-dir ./data/config \
  --http-bind 127.0.0.1:5080 \
  --mgmt-bind 127.0.0.1:9113 \
  --syslog-bind 127.0.0.1:5514
```

Now, you can access:

 - the WebUI at http://localhost:5080
 - the API documentation at http://localhost:5080/api/docs
 - the Syslog Server at [udp://localhost:5514]()
 - the Management API at [http://localhost:9113](http://localhost:9113):
    - `/health`: health check, always return `200 OK`
    - `/metrics`: Prometheus Exporter

A default user `root` (password: `root`) and a default pipeline are bootsrapped
if no configuration exists during startup.

To build the Docker image `linksociety/flowg:latest` locally:

```bash
task docker:build
```

## :rocket: Deploy

Using Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 5080:5080/tcp \
  -p 9113:9113/tcp \
  -p 5514:5514/udp \
  -v flowg-data:/data \
  linksociety/flowg:latest
```

Using Kubernetes (and Helm):

```bash
helm install flowg ./k8s/charts/flowg -n flowg-system --create-namespace
```

## Initial Admin User Credentials

When starting FlowG for the first time (i.e., when no users exist), you can configure the initial admin user credentials in two ways:

### 1. Command Line Flags (Recommended)

Specify the initial admin username and password directly:

```bash
flowg-server --auth-initial-user=admin --auth-initial-password=secret
```

### 2. Environment Variables (Advanced/For Docker/K8s)

Set environment variables **before** starting the server.  
**Note:** This only works if you do NOT specify the CLI flags.

```bash
export FLOWG_AUTH_INITIAL_USER=admin
export FLOWG_AUTH_INITIAL_PASSWORD=secret
flowg-server
```

- If neither the flags nor the environment variables are set, the default credentials will be `root` / `root`.
- The initial user is only created if no users exist in the system.
- For Docker or Kubernetes deployments, set these environment variables in your container or deployment spec.

**Troubleshooting:**  
If you set the environment variables but still see `Key not found` errors, make sure:
- You are not also passing the CLI flags (CLI flags take precedence).
- You have deleted any previous authentication data (`rm -rf ./data/auth/*`) before starting the server.
