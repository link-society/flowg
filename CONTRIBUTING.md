### Submitting Pull Requests

Here are some guidelines on how to format your PRs:

 - Use a descriptive title for the PR
 - Fill the information requested by the template
 - Prefix the title of your PR with the appropriate [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev)
 - Prefix your commit messages with the appropriate [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev)
 - Keep your PR up to date to the main branch by rebasing it, not using merges

If you don't follow those guidelines, you at least accept that a Code Owner will
take the time to edit your PR to make it fit our guidelines.

[Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) should be typed out as text, not UTF-8 glyphs.
They will be rendered by Github, giving a nice visual indicator of the kind of
change you are submitting, and yet will still be easily "greppable".
